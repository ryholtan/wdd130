      <p>
        This website is just a little biased. I honestly don't feel bad at all about that though because you are really only here to 
        learn about me or to hack me. If you are here for the second one, shame on you. If you're here for the first one, well thanks!
        Welcome to My..space...
        Wow, 2003 all over again.....

        To start off, I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I am a husband to my beautiful wife and I am a
        father to my son. After those, I like to call myself somewhat of a code enthusiast. I have loved it ever since I realized I had
        the ability to do it. (of course, who wouldn't love to learn how to do magic??)

        Below you will see a picture of my family and a picture of the temple my wife and I were sealed in (married legally speaking).
        this particular temple is in downtown Philedelphia and the inside looks just like many of the surrounding historical buildings.

        I also love to powerlift and strength train so if you're a recruiter and you have any gym acess at all to mention, don't pass that up!

      <h3>Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        Like many portfolios, this is a collection of some of my projects either at home or for school. If you see something you would
        like to imporve on or to know more about, just reach out to my github for the source. Thanks for looking!!

        or if you would just like to talk about some contract details, call me!

        I try to make sure all of my work is affordable for the specific market it is coupled with. I can always make changes, please submit 
        your comments on what could be better here!
