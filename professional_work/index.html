                <h2>This website is just a little biased. I honestly don't feel bad at all about that though because you are really only here to learn about me or to hack me. If you are here for the second one, shame on you. If you're here for the first one, well thanks! Welcome to My..space... Wow, 2003 all over again..... </h2>
                <p>To start off, I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I am a husband to my beautiful wife and I am a father to my clever son. After those, I like to call myself somewhat of a code enthusiast. I have loved it ever since I realized I had the ability to do it. (Of course, who wouldn't love to learn how to do magic??)
                    This is the temple my wife and I were sealed in for time and all eternity (married legally speaking). This particular temple is in downtown Philadelphia. Interesting fact, the inside of this temple was modeled after the many historical buildings from the area that have to do with the founding of the United States of America.

                <h2>This is a picture of my family under a pavillion at the church we attend</h2>
                <p>I am a very driven person, in particular when speaking of puzzles. When I am writing code and it just doesn't work, I typically need to be pulled off of it by my wife because 
                    every step that I get closer to "solving" it makes me that much more excited! I am also the kind of guy you should never count out. In highschool I was known to be somewhat of a 
                    trouble maker (not malicious, mostly playful and a little rebellious) and I also wasn't exactly looked at for the honor roll. So my friend at the time thought it would be funny if she bought me
                    a rubriks cube becuase she and her family figured that I would never be able to solve it. I thought it was a funny gesture but something inside of me clicked and I needed to be able to solve that 
                    little multicolored cube, so I could prove it to myself and the world! Now, I still can't solve a rubriks cube by logic alone (which is how I figure the world record holders do it), however that night
                    was spent on youtube, the whole night, and in one night I memorized all of the algorithems I needed to know to solve it in public and show just how smart (or determined?) I am.
                    I also love to strength train so if you're a recruiter and you have any gym acess at all to mention, don't pass that up!</p>
